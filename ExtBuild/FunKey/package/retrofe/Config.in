	  RetroFE is a front-end, which can be used as a graphical
	  user interface to display, select and launch your games,
	  videos, and programs. Its most common usage is for game
	  emulation. RetroFE allows you to define collections, which
	  can be displayed using a menu structure with additional
	  artwork like video, box art, screenshots, etc.
